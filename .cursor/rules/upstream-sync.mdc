# Upstream Sync Enforcement

- Follow `docs/UPSTREAM_SYNC_RULES.md` when reconciling with `docker/metadata-action` (v5.x) (https://github.com/docker/metadata-action).
- Preserve git-only/offline behavior: no `@actions/github` or GitHub API calls; prefer git CLI and workflow event payloads.
- Keep documentation clear about what upstream tag is mirrored; rebuild `dist/` after any `src/` changes.
- When auditing `dist/` for forbidden API usage, scan the runtime bundle (`dist/index.js`); ignore sourcemaps (`dist/*.map`) which may embed upstream URLs in comments.
